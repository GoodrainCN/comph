### Engergy
>Electrical Energy refers to the work done by electricity in any form.  
Therefore the work done by the ampere force is the electrical energy  
$E_{e}=F_{A}\cdot D$  
$F_{A}=BIL$  
$E_{e}=BIL\cdot D$  

>Kinetic Energy  
Kinetic Energy refers to The energy possessed by an object in mechanical motion.  
$E_{k}=\dfrac{1}{2}mv^{2}$  

>Gravitational Potential  
Gravitational potential energy is the energy possessed by an object due to the action of gravity  
$E_{p}=-\dfrac{GMm}{r}$
