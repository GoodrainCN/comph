### Coil Gun

#### Introduction
The cannon is composed of two parts: a fixed coil and a projectile coil. The electromagnetic force is generated by the mutual inductance gradient of the coaxial coil. The fixed coil acts as the barrel of the cannon, and if a strong magnetic field is generated by the passage of current, an induced current is formed in the projectile coil at the same time, so that the cannonball can be launched at a high speed by the electromagnetic force generated between the magnetic field and the induced current. The basic principle is that a charged conductor or magnetic object is propelled forward by electromagnetic force in a magnetic field. The diagram below.

Though in this project I only simulate for one unit of coil

### Introduction to Force & Energy

#### Magnetic Induction
Magnetic field induction inside a
solenoid is determined by a number of
turns per length n and current I (no
core):  

$ \oint \overrightarrow{B}\cdot dl=\mu _{0}I$  

Shortened as  

$ B=\mu _{0}nI$  

Assume the potential difference in the circuit is stable...

#### Ampere Force
Ampere’s law of force is the “law of
action” between current carrying circuits
through magnetic field.  
Assume the magnetic filed is uniform...  
$ F=BIL$

#### Engergy
Electrical Energy refers to the work done by electricity in any form.  
Therefore the work done by the ampere force is the electrical energy  
$E_{E}=\dfrac{1}{2}LI^{2}$  
L refers to the inductance  
$L=\dfrac{\mu N^{2}A}{l}$

μ = Permeability (Wb/Am)  
N = The coil’s number of turns  
A = The coil’s cross sectional area   
l = Length of coil (m)  


Kinetic Energy  
Kinetic Energy refers to The energy possessed by an object in mechanical motion.  
$E_{k}=\dfrac{1}{2}mv^{2}$  
m = mass (kg)  
v = velocity (m/s)  

Gravitational Potential  
Gravitational potential energy is the energy possessed by an object due to the action of gravity  
$E_{p}=-\dfrac{GMm}{r}$

### Experiment Question

What is the potential relationship between the magnitude of current and ball's average velocity?

### Experiment Result

The projectile of the bullet when the current is 30000A is shown below:

The relationship of velocity and ampere:
Therefore, the relationship between velocity and ampere is exponential growth.  

The greater magnitude of current, the object will have greater average velocity.

#### Energy
The eletrical energy when the device is fully charged is about 628318530J when the current is 10000 A. The kinetic energy of the object when it pass through is about 0.2 J.

### Conclusion

The energy conversation is very poor in this CoilGun design. 

The relationship between the magnitude of current and average velocity is increasing exponentially. The greater magnitude of current, the object will have greater average velocity.
